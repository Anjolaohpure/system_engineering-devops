# and send it a SIGTERM signal (the default signal for 'kill').

# by printing a message, rather than terminating immediately.

# Find the Process ID (PID) of the '7-highlander' process.
# Using 'ps aux' to list all processes.
# 'grep '[7]-highlander'' is a common trick to match the process name
# but avoid matching the 'grep' command itself.
# 'awk '{print $2}'' extracts the second column, which is the PID.
